## Introduction

Our application is a heart disease risk analysis tool designed to calculate the probability of an individual’s risk of developing heart disease. Utilizing advanced statistical methods and discrete mathematics principles, this tool analyzes a wide range of factors to quantify risk levels accurately. Our goal is to provide a resource that individuals and healthcare providers can use to assess heart disease risk and implement preventive measures effectively.

## Features

The application evaluates the following factors to predict heart disease risk:

- **Age**: Analyzes how the risk of heart disease escalates with age.
- **Gender**: Compares heart disease risk between males and females.
- **Family History**: Considers genetic predispositions to heart disease.
- **Smoking**: Evaluates the impact of long-term smoking habits on heart disease risk.
- **Diet**: Assesses the role of diet, particularly focusing on high cholesterol and high-fat intake.
- **Physical Activity**: Examines the difference in heart disease risk between sedentary and active lifestyles.
- **Obesity**: Investigates the correlation between Body Mass Index (BMI) and heart disease.
- **Diabetes**: Understands how diabetes contributes to the risk of developing heart disease.
- **High Blood Pressure**: Analyzes the effects of hypertension on heart health.
- **Stress and Mental Health**: Considers how chronic stress and mental health issues may influence heart disease risk.
- **Alcohol Consumption**: Looks at the impact of moderate versus heavy drinking on heart health.
- **Sleep Patterns**: Explores the relationship between sleep quality/duration and heart disease risk.

## Objective

By integrating discrete mathematics and statistical methods learned in class, we aim to create a predictive model that accurately quantifies an individual's risk level for heart disease. The ultimate vision for this tool is to develop a software application that can be readily used by individuals or healthcare professionals to assess risks and prioritize preventative healthcare measures effectively.

## Potential Impact

This tool has the potential to significantly impact how individuals and healthcare providers approach heart disease prevention. By offering a comprehensive analysis of various risk factors, it enables a proactive approach to health and wellness, encouraging lifestyle adjustments and interventions that can substantially reduce the risk of heart disease.
